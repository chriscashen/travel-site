# Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

Node.js (v10 or higher)
npm (Node Package Manager)

# Installation
Follow these steps to install and set up Parcel:

Clone the project repository to your local machine.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's root directory.

Run the following command to install the project dependencies:


# Development Server
To start the development server with Parcel, use the following command:

npm run dev

This will start Parcel and bundle your project's assets. Parcel will also watch for changes in your source files and automatically update the browser with the latest changes. The development server will be accessible at http://localhost:1234.


# Build
To build your project for production, use the following command:

npm run build

Parcel will optimize and bundle your assets for production, creating a dist directory with the bundled files. These files can then be deployed to a web server or hosting platform.
